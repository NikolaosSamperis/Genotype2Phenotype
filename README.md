# Genotype2Phenotype
**Genotype2Phenotype** is a data-driven project aimed at exploring the impact of gene knockouts on mouse phenotypes using statistical analysis, database management, and interactive visualizations.

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains scripts and resources for:
- **🔍 Data Cleaning & Processing**: Ensuring accuracy and consistency in IMPC phenotypic data.
- **🗄️ Database Creation & Management**: Designing and implementing a scalable MySQL database to store genotype-phenotype associations.
- **📊 Interactive Dashboard**: Developing an RShiny application to visualize gene knockout effects on phenotypes.

## 🌟 Features
- **Query mouse genotype-phenotype data** with MySQL.
- **Visualize phenotype significance scores** for different gene knockouts.
- **Identify clusters of genes** with similar phenotypic effects.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **R** (Data Processing & Visualization)
- **MySQL** (Database Management)
- **RShiny** (Interactive Dashboard)

## 📊 Visualizations
The RShiny dashboard provides three key visualizations:
1. **Gene Knockout Analysis** – Select a specific knockout mouse and visualize the affected phenotypes.
2. **Phenotype-Wide Analysis** – View statistical scores of all knockouts for a selected phenotype.
3. **Gene Clustering** – Identify genes with similar phenotype impact based on statistical scores.

## 🛠 Setup & Installation
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- R and RStudio
- MySQL Server

### **Database Setup**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bpulugundla/Genotype2Phenotype.git
   cd Genotype2Phenotype
   ```
2. Import the database schema:
   ```sh
   mysql -u root -p < database/dcdm_project_final.sql
   ```

### **Running the RShiny Dashboard**
1. Open `dashboard/app.R` in RStudio.
2. Run the app using:
   ```r
   shiny::runApp()
   ```
